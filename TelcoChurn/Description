· Telco Churn

· Project to use luigi pipelining framework

· Project aims to leverage luigi for building a machine learning pipeline.

· The data being used from a telecom company to understand what factors would influence the attrition rate. Attrition, customers leaving the business.

· Luigi workflow consists of tasks, targets and parameters. Task Execution and can state dependencies
  Target -  Where you want to write the data or store the data

· Parameters - Takes care of task parameterization.
  Graphical user interface

Description automatically generated

Entire pipeline is divided into multiple luigi tasks performing different operations.
First luigi task is to read the CSV:
CSV files consists of telco data customer information , internet service, contract , billing, churn column .

· Second step:

Preprocessing a Dropped columns like customer id, converted the attributes for gender with 0 and 1.
Attributes that has yes or no values to have 0,1
cleaning data so it can be used for machine learning models.
Dropped all null values
assigning dummy values to few of the columns.
stored as preprocess csv. These are clean features model.

features. All columns except churn
target is churn column.
Defined a data frame to track the
Dataframe had training , testing accuracies, false positive and the likes that would help decide which model is performing better.
metrics of each machine earning model.  The final machinelearning model comparison is stored in CSV.
Finally chose Random forest classifier model after fine tuned the model using grid search and then pickled it.

The final output of the model is either 1 or 0. Used different models .

Created a flask application with ten fields.  These were identified as determinant actors and based on this, the model would predict the churn factor for the customer.
We dockerized the machin learning pickled file, requirements.txt and app.py the main runner of flask application.
